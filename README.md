# Google Mobility Data for Philippines in 2021-2022
A visualization of Google Mobility Data for Ph 2021-2022

## Description
This project was initially for a presentation. I tried replicating what Hugh Sheehy did for their Looker Dashboard, but it was not an exact replica due the the difference in y-axis values. In my visualization, I used the `percent change` while Sheehy used something else.
